Enterprise mobility management (EMM)

- Register all API calls in DB table
- Create API calls for stuff that is not JS files or DB functions (like PHP or python)

Modules to write:
- Shopping cart module
- DAV

1.1.0:
- Broadcast/discover other grape services (using SSDP)
- API logger (partitioned tables monthly? or write session logs to a file)
	- settings: 
- Patch tables
- HTTP DIGEST authentication

Future:
- Define all API calls in JSON schema - call JS file from it
- Theme manager
- Email queuer
- Check permissions in javascript (keep a synced permissions list from DB to check against) notifications are done here
- Static data loader keeping cache of users and sessions

- Run a grape app without a database
- create an authentication provider

- Settings management:
	- Store all settings in DB
	- Add setting access roles
	- Add setting categories
	- Make available in node upon startup

- API call to get table information (part of table_operations.sql)


- Defining API calls in the SQL files directly:
	1. /** @api_usage @api_url etc
	2. load roles on startup as well (no need to put it separately in data files)

- Socket.IO integration

- make grape a WebDAV server
- Document store:
	- Integrate with WebDAV

- SOAP API

- Input validation for grape settings

Done:
- create API calls from JSON schema
- send email via API call
- pdf generator: pass xsl parameters to the pdfgenerator
- accept HTTP authentication instead of X-SessionID (look at Authorization header)
- Loading roles from schema
- System/Frontend integrator - HTTP server that relays api calls to connected systems. HTTP requests (API calls and HTML downloads etc) can be rewritten on the fly. /cabsav/...
- compiled javascript needs to be cached
- Send system notifications through HTTP headers
- Send SMSes
- Two-factor authentication
