- email queuer
- check permissions in javascript (keep a synced permissions list from DB to check against) notifications are done here
- static data loader keeping cache of users and sessions

- run a grape app without a database
- create an authentication provider
- compiled javascript needs to be cached

- Send system notifications through HTTP headers

- Make settings available in node

- API call to get table information (part of table_operations.sql)

- System/Frontend integrator - HTTP server that relays api calls to connected systems. HTTP requests (API calls and HTML downloads etc) can be rewritten on the fly. /cabsav/...

- Send SMSes

- API logger (partitioned tables monthly?)
	- settings: 

- Loading roles from schema

- Defining API calls in the SQL files directly:
	1. /** @api_usage @api_url etc
	2. load roles on startup as well (no need to put it separately in data files)

Done:
- create API calls from JSON schema
- send email via API call
- pdf generator: pass xsl parameters to the pdfgenerator
- accept HTTP authentication instead of X-SessionID (look at Authorization header)
